Google trivia is a quiz app that asks the user about historical landmarks of google. Once a user attempts the questions and submits his/her answers, a message pops up to tell the user their attained score.
Google trivia also has a reset option to erase all selected and inputted answers so you can start the quiz from the beginning and also an exit option to kill the Application when you're done with it.
